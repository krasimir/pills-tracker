# pills-tracker

Static vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript app for tracking your daily dose of pills

I got prescribed with 5 different pills to take every day, and I wanted a simple app to track my daily intake. The app stores data in the browser's local storage, so no backend is needed. There is no server or anything. Just load the `index.html` file in your browser and start using it.
